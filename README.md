## Implementation Notes

This app was live-coded during a skills assessment job interview with the
following constraints:
- no prior knowledge of what kind of app is going to be made
- no prior knowledge of the detailed specs of the app
- time limit of 2 hours

These are the core requirements of the app:
1. Create a TODO item
2. Toggle item as in/complete
3. Nest a TODO item-list inside an item

These were the extra feature requests, since I finished the core requirements
in more or less 45 minutes:
1. Data Persistence (either client or server)
2. Flat Array data structure, in preparation for SQLite data storage
3. Toggle an in/complete state of an item's subitems

Implementing the three feature requests took about 40 minutes.

This app is automatically deployed to Firebase Hosting whenever I push to the
`master` branch of this repository.
